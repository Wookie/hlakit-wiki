==Cart==

Preprocessor settings for specifying the block and bank size, as well as if the ROM has an EEPROM and what type it is.  Add a setting for specifying the initial value of AUDIOIN pin.

==Misc==

**#lnx.off**

Normally, HLAKit will put a standard .lnx file header on any Lynx ROM binary image it creates.  This option turns off outputting a header.
