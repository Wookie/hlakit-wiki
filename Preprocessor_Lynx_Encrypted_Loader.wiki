=Encrypted Loader=

When the Atari Lynx boots, the built-in ROM code loads and decrypts a single 256 byte frame of RSA encoded executable into memory location 0x0200 and then jumps to it.  This initial executable is called the loader.  It is possible to have a loader larger than 256 bytes long by making the first frame of loader code adjust a variable in the zero page and then jumping back to the RSA load and decrypt function in the Atari Lynx ROM.

After every frame of data is loaded and decrypted, the ROM code jumps to 0x0200.  That means you need to use self-modifying code at the beginning of the first frame to load multiple frames.  There is a more extensive description [[http://www.classicgamedev.com/Blog:Hacking_Classics/Lynx_Encryption|here]]

**#lynx.loader function**

The HLAKit Lynx Platform code supports designating a loader function that gets wrapped in some boilerplate loader code and then gets encrypted using the known Lynx RSA private key.

====Examples====
{{{
#!c
#lynx.loader loader

function loader() 
{
    // loader code
}
}}}
