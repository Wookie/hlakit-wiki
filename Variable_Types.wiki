=Variable Types=

HLAKit supports a fairly standard set of type names.  For complex data structures, there is a struct syntax for conglomerating basic types into structures.

It is important to note that the **dword** and the 32-bit **pointer** types are only present on CPU's that support them (e.g. 32-bit CPU's).  On 8/16-bit CPU's like the 6502, there is no **dword** and the **pointer** type is 16-bits.
