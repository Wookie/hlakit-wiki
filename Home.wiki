==Introduction==
HLAKit is a new compiler for a language based on NESHLA (NES High Level Assembler) by Brian Provinciano.  The old NESHLA compiler is targeted only at the NES system and has lots of NES-specific features in both the language and the standard library.  HLAKit aims to be a compiler for a more general HLA language targeted at as many old video game consoles and computers as possible.

The HLAKit compiler is implemented in Python and uses the pyparsing module to handle all of the language parsing.  The goal is to structure the compiler in such a way that all platform/CPU specific pieces of the language are modular and swappable.  Currently, the list of platform and/or CPU specific parts includes: assembly opcodes, register names, if/while test values, and preprocessor directives.  These will be explained in more detail later on.

Why do this?  An HLA language gives a nice balance between structured programming (like C) and assembly language.  It allows one to program using functions, structs, named variable, if-else blocks and while loops while still preserving low-level control over the machine.  Unlike C, the HLA understood by the HLAKit compiler uses assembly for the body of functions.  When you are coding for old, 8-bit and 16-bit computers, assembly language is the only way to be sure you are getting the most out of the machine.
