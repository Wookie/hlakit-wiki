There are a few of subtle differences between the NESHLA language and the HLAKit language.  This page details those differences so that you can port your NESHLA code over to HLAKit.

==The ##sizeof## Keyword==

In NESHLA, there existed a ###sizeof## keyword that replaced itself with the size of the parameter.  In HLAKit the # has been dropped to make it a keyword like ##typedef##, ##struct##, and ##shared##.

====NESHLA====
{{{
#!c
cpy #sizeof(PALETTE)
}}}

is now:

====HLAKit====
{{{
#!c
cpy sizeof(PALETTE)
}}}

This makes HLAKit a little more like what C programmers are used to.
