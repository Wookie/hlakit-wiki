There are a few of subtle differences between the NESHLA language and the HLAKit language.  This page details those differences so that you can port your NESHLA code over to HLAKit.

==6502 Indirect Addressing==

In the old NESHLA compiler, the indirect addressing mode for the JMP instruction used square brackets around an address: 

====NESHLA====
{{{
jmp [$FFFD]
}}}

But in HLAKit, the indirect addressing uses parenthesis around an address:

====HLAKit====
{{{
jmp ($FFFD)
}}}

The parenthesis how almost every other 6502 assembler handles indirect addressing.
